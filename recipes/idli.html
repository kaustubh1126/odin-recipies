This Idli recipe is one of the earliest recipe from the blog which has been tried and tested with great results by many of our readers. </p>

       <h2>Ingridients</h2>

       <ul>
           <li>½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice or regular rice – 100 grams</li>
            <li> ½ cup regular rice – 100 grams</li>
            <li>¼ cup urad dal – 50 grams (husked whole or split black gram)</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds or 2 pinches (methi seeds or methi dana)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thick poha (flattened rice)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups water – for soaking both rice and lentils</li>
            <li>¾ cup water – for grinding, do add water as required</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon rock salt edible and food grade or non-iodized salt or sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt</li>
            <li>oil as required</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>

       <ol>
           <li>In a bowl take the idli rice or parboiled rice along with the regular white rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice.</li>
           <li>Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients in a wet grinder jar.</li>
           <li>Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of batter is also fine. 
           </li>
           <li>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make idli. </li>
           <li>Now take a ladle full of the batter. Pour the dosa batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards.</li>
           <li>Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. The base will leave the pan and the sides will also get separated when it gets cooked.</li>
           <li>Serve these crisp plain dosa with sambar or potato masala or coconut chutney.</li>
       </ol>
